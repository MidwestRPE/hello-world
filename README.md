Socrates was poisoned for his anti-democratic views of society. On a day in 399 BC the philosopher Socrates stood before a jury of 500 of his fellow Athenians accused of "refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state" and of "corrupting the youth." The jurors later found him guilty by a vote of 280 vs 220. They also voted that his penalty should be death, by drinking a cup of poison hemlock. In the end, he was killed for his beliefs, while his peers wept along side him as they watched him die.
